# Stranger Things Intro

This project is a recreation of the iconic "Stranger Things" title sequence using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Introduction

The intro includes dynamic text animations and transitions, synchronized with an audio track. The project utilizes Modernizr checks to ensure compatibility with essential features and provides fallbacks for unsupported browsers.

## Features

- **Dynamic Text**: The text elements are dynamically animated, creating the signature "Stranger Things" title effect.

- **Audio Integration**: The intro plays an audio track ("StrangerThings.mp3") synchronized with the animation for an immersive experience.

- **Compatibility Checks**: Modernizr checks ensure compatibility with essential features like audio, CSS animations, and text shadow, providing fallbacks for unsupported browsers.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser, preferably Google Chrome, for the best experience.
3. Ensure your browser supports audio, CSS animations, and text shadow for the complete effect.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the text, colors, and other visual elements by modifying the HTML and CSS files. Add your own audio track to personalize the experience.
